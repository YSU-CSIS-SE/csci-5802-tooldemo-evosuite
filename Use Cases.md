# Use Cases for EvoSuite
EvoSuite provides automatic test generation for Java projects.  One of the key uses for automatic test generation is regression testing--that is, ensuring that the various classes and methods in the software continue to behave as they did when the tests were generated.  It is worth noting, however, that existing bugs in the software will not be exposed with these automatically generated tests.


Evosuite is an automatic test generator that creates JUnit 4 test for Java projects. For the tests it has produced Evosuite will suggest the use of possible oracles by adding small and effective sets of assertions that summerize the current behavior (http://www.evosuite.org/evosuite/). One of the main uses for automatic test generation is regeression testing-- that is, ensuring that the various classes and methods in the software continue to behave as they did when the tests were generated. Any bugs that were in the software will not be exposed with these tests.

Systems to run on: Intellij IDEA, Eclispe, Maven
