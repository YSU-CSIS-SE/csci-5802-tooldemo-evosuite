## EvoSuite

EvoSuite is a tool for automatically generating regression unit tests for Java software packages. It can be used with eclipse, maven, and intellij as a plugin or it can be simply be used from the command line.

Setup: The setup is rather easy for each system you use. For maven you must configure the pom.xml of the project you wish to use it with and add to it. Intellij . Eclipse. And for the command line (commands)

Run: To run you would start the program as you normally would as the tests were already made and are part of the program.

Use: As mentioned above evosuite is used for making junit 4 tests and is setup before running the program.

Evaluation: Easy to learn - It is pretty easy to learn since there are multiple tutorials for evosuite so it scores pretty well here.
            Platforms - Including the use of command line it has a total of 4 platforms to perform with which is pretty good but there                             are still systems that do not use it.
            Usage - Evosuite is limited to only being used in Java and even then it is limited on what it is used on but still it does what it is supposed to.
